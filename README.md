The ArithmeticTasks class provides static methods for solving tasks from a document Task01.docx:

1. Write a program that allows you to determine the last digit of a number by the last digit of its square.
2. Create a program that determines the number of days in this month based on the specified year and month number, and correctly determines all leap years.
3. The circle is inscribed in the square of the specified area. Find the area of the square inscribed in this circle. How many times is the area of the inscribed square smaller than the area of the given square?
4. Create a program that prints the value true if the specified statement is true, and false-otherwise: among the given integers A, B, C, D there are at least two even ones.
5. Create a program that prints the value true if the specified statement is true, and false otherwise: whether the integer is perfect (the sum of the divisors is equal to the number itself).
6. There is the nth second of the day, determine how many full hours, full minutes and seconds have passed by this moment.
7. Given two points A (x1, y1) and B (x2, y2). Create an algorithm that determines which of the points is closer to the origin. x y.
8. Calculate the function value:
    F(x) = {(-x^2 + 3x + 9, if x >= 3) or (1/(x^3-6), if x<3)
    
9. Calculate the length of the circle and the area of the circle of the same given radius R.
10. Create a program for calculating the values of the function F (x) on the segment [a, b] with a step h. The result is presented in the form of a table, the first column of which is the values of the argument, the second is the corresponding values of the function.
    F(x) = tan(x)
